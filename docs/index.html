	How I made this blog

	As a blog is a static website, there is no need for it to be more than a set of static pages. Why would you want to render a page each time someone visits it if there is nothing dynamic on it? It is way simpler to render each page once and then serve static pages.
</p>

<p>
	The added bonus is that then, there is no need for hosting, Github does it freely for you :)
</p>

<p>
	As I searched for a simple solution to put a basic blog online, I only crossed heavy duty frameworks. Even the basic static website generators looked pretty complex. They always require you to have a full dev environment on your computer. I hate maintenance, and the more complex the solution you use, the more layers it has, the more likely it is to have issues in the future.
</p>

<p>
	Therefore, I decided to create a simple one myself. I took me about one hour to write a basic page generator/stitcher in Python.
</p>

<p>
	I pushed the source code here: <a href="https://github.com/lephoquesportif/blog">https://github.com/lephoquesportif/blog</a>
</p>

<p>
	You only need Python on your machine to execute it, which is strait forward to install on any system.
</p>

<p>
	I can now focus on the content rather than trying to understand what is lurking behind the web framework I use. And you don't need to load a javascript file the length of war and peace to in order read my crappy articles.
